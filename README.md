# Number-to-word
 I have created two lists one containing one, two ,
three up to nine i.e. nu (list used in program) and second 
list containing twenty, thirty, up to ninety i.e. digit (list
used in program)

I have taken float input from user and separated each 
digit and stored it in another list l.

To get appropriate word for digit I have created another 
list which contains wording of digits present in input 
then index wise I have given input to format method.

Using format method I have represented the number into 
wording.
And finally I have printed output.
